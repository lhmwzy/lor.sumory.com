Please make sure that you use the documents that match your `lor` version.
The version number should be a part of the page URL. If it's not, you are
probably using the documentation of a development branch which may contain API
changes that are not compatible with your `lor` version. If that's the case,
you can switch to a different version of the documentation at the
[available versions](/docs/) list.
